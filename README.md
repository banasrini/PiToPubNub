PiToPubNub
==========
Some people know, just how powerful the Raspberry Pi is. It is smaller than your palm, but can double up as your PC and is infact even more capable than our regular computers when it comes to reading the environment around us. The Pi can be used to control other devices as well as collect information from them. What better way to jump into the IoT space if not through the powerful Pi. Using PubNub's real time global network and the capabilities of the Pi, the applications are countless. 

Here, I have demonstrated how to connect the Raspberry Pi to the PubNub network with less than 10 lines of code. To see it in action locally, clone the source from Github and run the Python script from the command line.
